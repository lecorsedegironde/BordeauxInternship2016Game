## Bastien's logs branch

The logs are writen with a template which is adapted from a template given by the IUT: 
	- Little description of the day
	- Tasks
	- Technical tools
	- Documentation read
	- Relational contacts
	- Realization & results
	- Difficulties
	- Initiatives & decisions
	- Gain & satisfying achievement
	- Other (if there is something else to add that doesn't fit any categories)

The file are divided in weeks folder (one for each week) and each log file is named with this template: 
	- MonthDayYear.log
